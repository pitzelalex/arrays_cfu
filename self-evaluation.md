# Arrays Self Evaluation

* **How confident do you feel with the content on Arrays so far?**

I'm fairly confident in it. Lots to learn and it'll be easier to understand once I see an array in a functioning project I think.

* **Is there any additional learning you need or want to do before moving to the next lesson?**

I think I'm good to move on to the next lesson. Gotta keep building!

* **What questions do you have about Arrays?**

I suppose I don't fully understand how they're implemented yet. I think my reservations about them will quickly fade as I see them in a more complete context.
